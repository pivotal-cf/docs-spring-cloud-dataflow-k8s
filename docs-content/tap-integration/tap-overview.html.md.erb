The Tanzu Application Platform integration described here is not yet a fully integrated solution.
Spring Cloud Data Flow for Kubernetes runs only on TAP clusters with this recommended approach.

## Migrating existing applications

This document outlines a way to integrate Spring Cloud Data Flow (SCDF) with
Tanzu Application Platform (TAP). We cover how to add a few TAP resources that will provide integration, allowing you to deploy streams using a custom TAP Workload and then view the applications making up the SCDF stream in TAP's Developer Portal.

<p class="note important">

The approach in this document have been tested with the most recent SCDF version 2.11.2 and TAP versions 1.7 and 1.8 using a `full` profile.

Use the following steps to migrate your Spring Cloud Data Flow to Tanzu Application Platform:

* Step 1: [Install Spring Cloud Data Flow in the TAP cluster](./install-tap.html.md.erb)
* Step 2: [Create a supply chain for the SCDF streams](./create-supply-chain.html.md.erb)
* Step 3: [Create an OCI image for the Tekton pipeline](./create-oci-image.html.md.erb)
* Step 4: [Test your deployment](./test-deploy.html.md.erb)
