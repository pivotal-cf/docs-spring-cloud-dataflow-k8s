title:Using a TAP Workload to create and deploy a stream
owner: Spring Cloud Data Flow Release Engineering

The sample stream is defined in a ticktock stream repository with the following YAML stream.yaml file:

```yaml
name: ticktock
description: Test stream for TAP
definition: time | log
deploymentProperties: app.time.date-format=YYYY/mm/dd,app.log.level=WARN
```

This pipeline could be triggered using a Workload referencing the pipeline using a workload-type label.
