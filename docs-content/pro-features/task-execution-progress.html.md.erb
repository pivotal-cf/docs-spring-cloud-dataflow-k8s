title: Task execution progress bar in Spring Cloud Data Flow

Spring Cloud Data Flow OSS allows you to track task execution status for each task definition on the Task Execution Detail page.
In addition to the task execution status, the Spring Cloud Data Flow Pro server adds support for displaying a progress indicator on the Task Execution Detail page.
This is done by calculating a percent complete using the duration of the current run time vs those of the previous execution run times for the task definition.

An example of the progress indicator is shown below in the graphic.

<p class="note">
<span class="note__title">Note</span>
The first execution of a task definition will show 99% complete because there are no previous task executions.</p>
