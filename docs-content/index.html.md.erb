## <a id='overview'></a> About Spring Cloud Data Flow for Kubernetes

VMware Spring Cloud® Data Flow for Kubernetes (SCDF for Kubernetes) is based on the Spring Cloud Data Flow open source project.
SCDF for Kubernetes orchestrates the deployment lifecycle of streaming and batch data pipelines deployed on Kubernetes.
Data pipelines are composed of Spring Cloud Stream or Spring Cloud Task applications.
You can use the streaming pipeline DSL and UI to specify which apps to deploy and how to connect outputs and inputs.
When running a series of task applications as a directed graph, you can use the composed task DSL and UI.
