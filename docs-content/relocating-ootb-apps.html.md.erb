title: Relocating Spring Cloud Stream and Task Applications
owner: Spring Cloud Data Flow Release Engineering

This topic describes how to relocate select Spring Cloud Stream and Spring Cloud Task applications.
This can be useful when the Spring Cloud Data Flow for Kubernetes server is deployed in an air-gapped environment.

To use as examples for this topic, we have selected three stream applications: the `http` source app, the `split` processor app and the `log` sink app.

<div class="note">Before you can use the relocated images with Spring Cloud Data Flow for Kubernetes, you would need to configure access to the registry where you relocate the images to.</div>

Review the following configuration sections: configuring the [Container Registry](configuring-installation-values.html#container-registry), and configuring [ImagePullSecrets for Apps](configuring-installation-values.html#imagePullSecrets)

## <a id='install-irel'></a> Install Image Relocation CLI utility

In order to relocate images we need a utility program that can help us create an OCI image layout that can be moved to an air-gapped environment.

For this topic we will be using a CLI utility called `imgpkg` that is available from the <a href="https://carvel.dev/imgpkg/">Carvel imgpkg project</a>.

Install the latest `imgpkg` CLI utility release following instructions at <a href="https://carvel.dev/imgpkg/docs/latest/install/">imgpkg install page</a>.
Select the instructions that match your operating system.

## <a id='relocate-images'></a> Relocate the Selected Applications

Before we relocate the OCI images for the three selected app images we need to select the versions we should relocate.
We will use the latest available images for the selected apps based on the content of the <a href="https://dataflow.spring.io/rabbitmq-docker-latest">Stream Apps (RabbitMQ/Docker)</a> property file.

The images we will relocate are:

* source.http=docker:springcloudstream/http-source-rabbit:3.1.1

* processor.splitter=docker:springcloudstream/splitter-processor-rabbit:3.1.1

* sink.log=docker:springcloudstream/log-sink-rabbit:3.1.1

First, define an environment variable for the registry prefix (substitute with the prefix to use for your target registry):

```bash
export TARGET_REGISTRY_PREFIX=registry.example.com/my-project/apps
```

Next, we use `imgpkg copy` to relocate each image.

For `http` source run:

```bash
imgpkg copy -i springcloudstream/http-source-rabbit:3.1.1 --to-repo ${TARGET_REGISTRY_PREFIX}/http-source-rabbit
```

For the `splitter` processor run:

```bash
imgpkg copy -i springcloudstream/splitter-processor-rabbit:3.1.1 --to-repo ${TARGET_REGISTRY_PREFIX}/splitter-processor-rabbit
```

For `log` sink run:

```bash
imgpkg copy -i springcloudstream/log-sink-rabbit:3.1.1 --to-repo ${TARGET_REGISTRY_PREFIX}/log-sink-rabbit
```

## <a id='register-stream-apps'></a> Register the Relocated Applications

We can now register the apps using the the Spring Cloud Data Flow Shell.

Replace the `registry.example.com/my-project/apps` prefix with the one you used for the relocation.

For `http` source run:

```bash
dataflow:>app register --name http --type source --uri docker:registry.example.com/my-project/apps/http-source-rabbit:3.1.1
```

For the `splitter` processor run:

```bash
dataflow:>app register --name splitter --type processor --uri docker:registry.example.com/my-project/apps/splitter-processor-rabbit:3.1.1
```

For `log` sink run:

```bash
dataflow:>app register --name log --type sink --uri docker:registry.example.com/my-project/apps/log-sink-rabbit:3.1.1
```

For more details, see the [Register a Stream Application](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#spring-cloud-dataflow-register-stream-apps) section of the [Spring Cloud Data Flow Reference Guide](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/).

## <a id='relocate-task-apps'></a> Relocate Task Applications

To relocate Spring Cloud Task applications and use them with SCDF for Kubernetes, you can perform the steps described in the previous sections, but registering the applications with the type `task`.
For more information, see the [Registering a Task Application](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#spring-cloud-dataflow-register-task-apps) section of the [Spring Cloud Data Flow Reference Guide](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/).
