This topic describes how to install the command-line tools that are required to install VMware Spring Cloud® Data Flow for Kubernetes (SCDF for Kubernetes).

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Command-line tools required to install SCDF for Kubernetes include the following:

* `kubectl`, the Kubernetes CLI (for more information about installing `kubectl`, see [Installing the Kubernetes CLI](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid-Integrated-Edition/1.16/tkgi/GUID-installing-kubectl-cli.html) in the VMware Enterprise PKS documentation)
* `sed` (should already be installed on your machine)
* `yq`, a command-line YAML processing utility that aims to be the `jq` or `sed` of YAML files (for more information about `yq`, see the [project home page](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) on GitHub)
* The following [Carvel](https://carvel.dev/) utilities:
  * `kapp`, a deployment utility that includes the concept of a "Kubernetes application": a set of resources with the same label (for more information about `kapp`, see the [Carvel website](https://carvel.dev/kapp/))
  * The `kbld` utility manipulates and replaces container images used in Kubernetes configuration files (for more information about `kbld`, see the [Carvel website](https://carvel.dev/kbld/))

For steps to install `kapp`, `kbld`, and `yq`, see the following sections. Follow the relevant procedures for your operating system and install the latest release of each tool.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: <code>kapp</code> and <code>kbld</code> are available from <a href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-scdf-for-kubernetes">VMware Tanzu Network</a>. Binaries are provided only for 64-bit architectures.</p>
